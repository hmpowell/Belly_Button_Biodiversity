# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Purpose

### The purpose of this assignment was to create a drop-down menu that will then show the corresponding demographic information of the test subject chosen. In addition, it will show a bar graph, bubble chart, and gauge chart to show additional information about the test subject and the bacteria found in their belly buttons. For the code, I used VSCode and Plotly, as well as HTML to put the information on a website to be utilized by the public.

### We were asked in the challenge to add a few features. I chose to add a photo to the page, change the background color, and add an informational paragraph underneath the heading of the page.
